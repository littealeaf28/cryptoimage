# Welcome to CryptoImage!
CryptoImage is a light web app that employs the concept of steganography to encode messages within images and decode images with messages encoded within them. The app was developed in the 2020 SwampHacks competition with the inspiration of secretly messaging friends by using images, especially in the context of group chats. 

Currently, CryptoImage has yet to be deployed, so in order to run the program within your localhost, you must have Node.js and Flask installed. Once you do...

## Running CryptoImage
1. Simply clone or download the project to your machine.

2. Run the following the commands inside the terminal. This will download the necessary dependencies and then open up the localhost:3000 on your browser!
```
npm install
npm start
```

## Encoding and Decoding! How It Works?
1. Choose an image and type a message that you would like to encode. Then press the lock to encodify. The program will create the encoded image that you can download and send to others.

2. To decode the message, input the encoded picture and press the lock.
