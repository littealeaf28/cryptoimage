# Welcome to CryptoImage!
Currently, CryptoImage has yet to be deployed, so in order to run the program within your localhost, you must have Node.js and Flask installed. Once you do...

1. Simply clone or download the project to your machine.

2. Run the following the commands inside the terminal. This will download the necessary dependencies and then open up the localhost:3000 on your browser!
```
npm install
npm start
```

3. Choose an image and type a message that you would like to encode. Then press the lock to encodify. The program will create the encoded image that you can download and send to others.

4. To decode the message, input the encoded picture and press the lock.
